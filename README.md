## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

What I learned that it is better to use a mobile-first approach, since it will be easier and require less code when converting to a desktop view.


### Continued development

I want to really improve on understanding deeper concepts and hopefully dive deep in JavaScript and React.
